  ## 1 - Define **polymorphism** in the context of Java and provide one example where it is valuable?
      - is a situation where a variable that has declared that something has a run time that is different than the compile time.
      - example: 
      
  ## 2 - Explain how polymorphism makes this program possible.

  ## 3- What is the output of this program? You should be able to do this without running the program!
       - the output of this program is A.

  ## 4- What is the output of this program? You should be able to do this without running the program!
        - this returns B fancyToString "~~B~~"

  ## 5- What is the output of this program? You should be able to do this without running the program!
        - the output prints out "A"

  ## 6- Consider the first two class declarations. What is the output of compiling the program below?

  ## 7 - If we change the implementation of A to the following, what does the code below output?

  ## 8 - What is the output of this program? You should do this without running the program.

  ## 9 - What is the output of the following snippet of code? If there is an ERROR, describe the error. **You should not need to run the code to determine the output.**

  ## 10 - Consider a mystery function that returns a object of the given class. **You do not know the definition of the mystery function, other than it compiles properly and returns an object of the class.** For each of the following method calls marked below, indicate the value of the output, if the output cannot be determined, or if there is an error.

  ## 11- What is the difference between a class and an abstract class? From a software engineering perspective, why would you ever want to use an abstract class instead of a regular class?

  ## 12 - If you were to create an abstract class for a Car â€“ what features could be defined in the implemented class vs. what could be defined in the abstract class? Provide justifications for your design.
