  ## 1 - Define **polymorphism** in the context of Java and provide one example where it is valuable?
      - is a situation where a variable that has declared that something has a run time that is different than the compile time.
      - example: 
      
  ## 2 - Explain how polymorphism makes this program possible.
      - when the object 'u' is declared, there is polymorphism that is seen because 'u' since it can become any of the 4 variables v, y, x & y. 
     allows the variables to referece an object of different types

  ## 3- What is the output of this program? You should be able to do this without running the program!
       - the output of this program is A.

  ## 4- What is the output of this program? You should be able to do this without running the program!
        - this returns B fancyToString "~~B~~"

  ## 5- What is the output of this program? You should be able to do this without running the program!
        - the output prints out "A"

  ## 6- Consider the first two class declarations. What is the output of compiling the program below?
        - it wont compie becasue the getname is declared as protected in yhr parent class 'letter' hovever it is trying to be called upon as a private in subclass A.

  ## 7 - If we change the implementation of A to the following, what does the code below output?
      
          

  ## 8 - What is the output of this program? You should do this without running the program.
        - System.out.println("foo1: " + B + " " + B);

  ## 9 - What is the output of the following snippet of code? If there is an ERROR, describe the error. **You should not need to run the code to determine the output.**
    - toString (breed)
      toString (speicies)
      tostring (breed)

  ## 10 - Consider a mystery function that returns a object of the given class. **You do not know the definition of the mystery function, other than it compiles properly and returns an object of the class.** For each of the following method calls marked below, indicate the value of the output, if the output cannot be determined, or if there is an error.
        a    |  b  |  d    | output a | output b | output d
     1- yes  | yes |  yes  | 42       | 41       | 42
     2- yes  | yes |  yes  | 50       | 49       | 7
     3- no   | yes |  no   | N/A      | y        | N/A
     

  ## 11- What is the difference between a class and an abstract class? From a software engineering perspective, why would you ever want to use an abstract class instead of a regular class?
      - you can never call the abstact class constructer directly you can only call it through 'super'

  ## 12 - If you were to create an abstract class for a Car â€“ what features could be defined in the implemented class vs. what could be defined in the abstract class? Provide justifications for your design.
